<h1>Interest in IT </h1>
<p>As I am majoring in Accounting, I wanted to take other subjects to learn new things that will broaden my mind. Technologies and internet are a big part of my life ever since young as I had been exposed to them since young.
  Many people had been recommending me to take IT as my major or minor as there is a large work opportunity and benefits from understanding IT and being able to apply it for the convenience of work in the future. My brother
  is a huge gadget fan and he would tell me different facts and technology items that I find interesting. I was quite amazed when I first started using MYOB which is a computerised accounting system for efficient and effective
  accounting recording and analysing system. Due to the convenience of the system, work could be done easy and effectively with less time consumption. It saves a lot of unnecessary physical documentation and storage space.
  That was when I decided to try out a course in IT. </p>

<h2>Why RMIT? </h2>
<p>I used to study Diploma in Professional Accounting and a senior of mine decided to take a course in RMIT and she was very positive of RMIT. I believe that RMIT would be able to provide necessary knowledge and education that
   would benefit my future. RMIT has a good reputation and system that I like, therefore I applied to take a course in RMIT. </p>

<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?  </h2>
<p>I would like to be able to learn different knowledge and skills that would be helpful and prepares me for my job in the future. There are many social skills that I can learn through working in teams and in organizing work tasks
   in the team.  </p>
