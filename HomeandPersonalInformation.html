<h2>Personal information</h2>

<h3>Name: Sue Wei Low</h3>
<h3>Student ID: S3760175</h3>
<h3>Student email: s3760175@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>

<p>I am currently studying Bachelor of Business majoring in Accounting here as an international student from Malaysia. I am a Malaysian born Chinese and
  there are a few languages that I can speak as I had grown up in a multicultural country of Malaysia. There are three major ethnic groups in Malaysia which
  are Malays, Chinese and Indian races. Malaysia is popular for the many types of food available as there are many ethnic groups from around the world. I
  finished diploma in Malaysia majoring in Accounting and then I moved to Melbourne to study in RMIT. I am in my last semester for my degree and I am still unsure whether I should take the CPA professional accounting paper or to work full time after graduating. </p>

<h3>Languages I speak</h3>
  <p>English, Malay, Chinese, Cantonese, Hakka and a little Korean. English is my first language and I started learning Chinese and Malay languages in school. The Malay language or it's called Bahasa Malaysia is Malaysia's National Language, therefore it is compulsory for every student to learn and understand. I attend a Chinese primary school and started learning the Chinese language there. Sometimes, I get some comments saying that it is weird that I use a few languages within a sentence when I speak and my friends get a little confused. I have a little story of how I learnt Hakka language which is a Malaysian Chinese ethnic group dialect. I used to spend a lot of time in my grandparent house and I was a little quiet and slowly while listening to my mum and grandparents speak, I started understanding and soon enough I was able to speak Hakka and shocked everyone. </p>

<h3>Interests</h3>
  <p>I like to explore different types of cuisines in my free time and find alternate healthier food and recipe ideas. The types of cuisines that I like to make are Western, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Italian, Mexican and Malaysian food. It is interesting to try different recipes and being able to make food that I crave. I am still quite new in cooking as I had only started cooking after I came to Australia. I could also spend hours and hours doing cross-stitch as I find it very therapeutic and relaxing. I turned a cartoon picture that I found online into a cross-stitch map to follow and it is a big picture and I am still trying hard to finish them. </p>
