<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p></p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>My project idea is to create an app called Greeny that connects people that are health conscious and environmentalists. The app allows health conscious people to contribute healthy recipes and if they would want to have a meal outside, it will show
  nearby restaurants that provides healthier choices. The app provides knowledge on sustainability and the 5Rs of responsibility to reduce, renew, replace, reuse and recycle. Users of the app could provide suggestions on ways to improve and to minimalize
  wastage and it would create a healthy community in the app. Better buying options will be included in the app and connect sustainability companies to users for convenience. </p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>This project idea will be useful to many people as there is a growing health awareness around the world and due to the increase in obesity crisis and health issues, people are growing to be more conscious of what they eat. 75% of global respondents agree
   that they are what they consume and 80% of people actively use food to prevent medical condition or health issues (Nielson, 2015). Australia millennials are also very fond of healthy food choices and are the biggest consumer group in healthy eating
   which consist of 32% (Npd, 2018). Reducing plastic pollution is also a global issue nowadays and many countries and placing importance to reduce plastic waste like Peru banned single-use plastic and the US wants to reduce plastic remarkably by 2030
   (Jia, Evans & Linden, 2019). </p>

<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The app firstly allows people to communicate their healthy food recipe options and how they manage to live a healthier lifestyle. There would be a platform for users to voice their problems and other users may provide solutions that would help them. As
   some people are new to living healthier, they might face issues in making their own meals. This will be able to spread more awareness of different ways to eat better. The recipes will also be categorized into different dietary requirements like vegan,
   vegetarian and for people with intolerances of dairy, gluten and many more. Users of health issues like diabetes and high cholesterol levels could also find relevant recipes that they could use. Users could include the ingredients required for recipes
   in their shopping list and purchase from the online food stores that are also environmentally friendly.</p>

   <p>Next, users and restaurants or cafes will provide information on their healthier food choices on the app and nearby people will be able to choose using their dining options in the app. As there are many food stores that would like to appeal to health-
   conscious consumers, this app will allow them to communicate to more people and consumers will be able to comment on their food. This provide convenience to people when they are out and looking for food alternatives. Users can order and pay online through
   the app so that they can save time on waiting for the food. There would be various promotion and discounted price to increase sales. Delivery options are also available for convenience. Users could drive or walk there through using maps within the app.</p>

   <p>There are knowledge articles in the app simplified for easy learning and understanding that would give users new ideas on ways to cut down on their waste and they could shop on environmentally friendly stores to purchase their daily necessities. The basic
   knowledge to start on healthy living and to practice 5Rs would be provided within to app for new users to understand. Users could provide their ways in actively doing 5Rs and share on the app. Eco-friendly online stores could be registered on the app to
   communicate their goods to users. Fresh produce stores could supply to users easily in raw form to reduce waste.  </p>

<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
<p>The knowledge of MIT App Inventor would be needed to create the app. It will help to create app for both Android and iOS users. In order to ensure security of the app, having a secure code will be important. The data of the app needs to be encrypted as well.
   High-level of authentication needs to be applied to protect users of the app. APIs that are authorized are to be used so that it ensures security. Technologies of tamper-detection needs to be deployed so that there would be alerts if there is an attack.
   Testing of the app would be required to ensure that the app would be secure (Panchal, 2018). </p>

<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>The skills required are to know how to use MIT App Inventor and encrypting correctly. It would also be important to have to the knowledge to ensure that the app is safe for user to use and it is needed to have security knowledge for the app. As there are
   many different options to create an app, it is important to choose the right platform and to create it. It is important to receive feedback from public users and professionals in IT on the app to check on its effectiveness in attracting users and for the
   protection of the app. </p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>If the app is successful, then there would be a lot of satisfied users. People would be able to lead a healthier lifestyle and the app would promote healthy food options to be provided in restaurants and cafes. This will increase the size of the healthy
  industry as people are seeking for healthier and environmentally friendly shops or restaurants. As the awareness to live healthier has grown, it may reduce health issues in the world and waste reduction products will appear more and more. This will help the
  environment to improve. If it is not successful, there might be a loss of cost in developing the app and there might be charges in breach of user protection by the authorities. User may not like the app and its features results in poor rating.   </p>
