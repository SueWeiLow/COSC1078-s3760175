<p>I am currently studying Bachelor of Business majoring in Accounting here as an international student from Malaysia. I am a Malaysian born Chinese and
  there are a few languages that I can speak as I had grown up in a multicultural country of Malaysia. There are three major ethnic groups in Malaysia which are Malays, Chinese and Indian races.</p>

<p>Languages I speak: English, Malay, Chinese, Cantonese, Hakka and a little Korean.</p>
<p>Interests:I like to explore different types of cuisines in my free time and find alternate healthier food and recipe ideas. I could also spend hours and hours doing cross-stitch as I find it very therapeutic and relaxing. </p>
